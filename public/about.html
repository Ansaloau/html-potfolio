Four years ago, I embarked on an exciting journey and made Australia my home. 
During this time, I've been working for the same company, gaining valuable experiences and skills. 
Recently, I decided to take a leap and give my professional path a new direction. 
I pursued a Master's degree in MBA and Corporate Communications, opening doors to new possibilities.

My current focus is on web development, a field that has captivated me with its boundless opportunities for creativity and problem-solving. 
I'm passionate about learning and have already begun my journey into the world of web development. 
My goal is to become a proficient web developer, capable of crafting both personal and professional projects with precision and flair.

Getting things done in a tidy and beautiful manner is something I take pride in.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am a proud cat mom.
